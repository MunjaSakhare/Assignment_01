      <h2>Cricket Information</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Cricket is one of the most popular outdoor sports in the world,
        especially in countries like India, England, Australia, and South
        Africa. It is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players
        each on a circular or oval-shaped field with a rectangular pitch at the
        center. The main objective of the game is to score more runs than the
        opposing team. Cricket requires a combination of physical fitness,
        mental concentration, strategic planning, and teamwork, making it both
        challenging and exciting.

        The game is played using a bat and a ball. One team bats to score runs
        while the other team bowls and fields to restrict scoring and dismiss
        the batters. Runs are scored by hitting the ball and running between the
        wickets or by hitting boundaries, such as fours and sixes. A batter can
        be dismissed in several ways, including being bowled, caught, run out,
        or leg before wicket (LBW). Each team alternates between batting and
        fielding depending on the format of the match.

        Cricket is played in various formats that differ in duration and style.
        Test cricket is the longest format, lasting up to five days and testing
        a player’s endurance and technique. One Day Internationals (ODIs) are
        limited to 50 overs per side and are known for balanced gameplay.
        Twenty20 (T20) cricket is the shortest and most entertaining format,
        limited to 20 overs per team, focusing on aggressive batting and
        fast-paced action.

        Cricket is governed internationally by the International Cricket Council
        (ICC), which organizes major tournaments such as the ICC Cricket World
        Cup, T20 World Cup, and Champions Trophy. Domestic leagues like the
        Indian Premier League (IPL), Big Bash League (BBL), and Pakistan Super
        League (PSL) have further increased the popularity of the sport. These
        leagues provide opportunities for young talent and entertain millions of
        fans worldwide.

        Beyond entertainment, cricket plays an important role in promoting
        discipline, leadership, and sportsmanship. It encourages physical
        fitness, sharp reflexes, and decision-making skills. For many players,
        cricket is not just a sport but a professional career, offering
        opportunities as players, coaches, umpires, commentators, and analysts.
        Cricket continues to unite people across cultures and nations, making it
        more than just a game.
