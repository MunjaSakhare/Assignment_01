      <h2>Hockey Information</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Hockey is a fast-paced and exciting team sport played in many countries
        around the world. Field hockey, commonly referred to simply as hockey in
        countries like India, is played between two teams of eleven players each
        on a rectangular field. Players use curved sticks to hit a small hard
        ball with the objective of scoring goals by sending the ball into the
        opponent’s goal. Hockey requires speed, skill, stamina, and excellent
        hand-eye coordination.

        A standard hockey match is divided into four quarters, each lasting
        fifteen minutes, with short breaks in between. The game begins with a
        center pass, and players move the ball by passing, dribbling, and
        striking it with the flat side of the stick. Goals can only be scored
        from within the shooting circle, making positioning and teamwork
        extremely important. The team that scores the most goals by the end of
        the match is declared the winner.

        Hockey involves both offensive and defensive strategies. Attackers focus
        on quick passes, strong shots, and penalty corners to score goals, while
        defenders aim to block passes, tackle opponents, and protect the goal
        area. Common penalties in hockey include free hits, penalty corners, and
        penalty strokes, which are awarded for rule violations such as dangerous
        play or obstruction.

        International hockey is governed by the International Hockey Federation
        (FIH), which organizes major tournaments such as the Hockey World Cup,
        Champions Trophy, and the Olympic hockey events. India has a rich
        history in hockey and has won multiple Olympic gold medals, making the
        sport an important part of the country’s sporting heritage. Professional
        leagues and international competitions continue to increase the
        popularity of hockey worldwide.

        Hockey offers numerous physical and mental benefits. It improves
        cardiovascular fitness, agility, balance, and reflexes while also
        teaching teamwork, discipline, and sportsmanship. Hockey can be pursued
        as a professional career with opportunities as players, coaches,
        umpires, trainers, and sports administrators. Its fast action and
        strategic gameplay make hockey a thrilling sport for both players and
        spectators.
