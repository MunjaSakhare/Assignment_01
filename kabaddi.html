      <h2>Kabaddi Information</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Kabaddi is a traditional Indian team sport that combines physical
        strength, speed, strategy, and mental toughness. It originated in
        ancient India and is widely played in countries such as India, Iran,
        Bangladesh, and South Korea. Kabaddi is played between two teams of
        seven players each on a rectangular court divided into two halves. The
        main objective of the game is for a player, known as a raider, to enter
        the opponent’s half, tag as many defenders as possible, and return
        safely to their own half without being tackled.
      </p>

      <p>
        A unique feature of Kabaddi is the requirement for the raider to
        continuously chant the word “Kabaddi” while holding their breath during
        the raid. This rule demonstrates breath control and ensures the raid is
        completed in a single attempt. Defenders, called anti-raiders, try to
        stop the raider by tackling them before they cross the midline. Points
        are awarded for successful raids and tackles, and players who are tagged
        or tackled are temporarily out of the game.
      </p>

        A standard Kabaddi match is divided into two halves of twenty minutes
        each, with a short break in between. Teams earn points through raids,
        successful tackles, and bonus points, while additional points are
        awarded when all players of the opposing team are eliminated, known as
        an “all-out.” The team with the highest number of points at the end of
        the match is declared the winner.

        Kabaddi has gained international recognition through professional
        leagues and global tournaments. The Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) has
        significantly increased the popularity of the sport by modernizing its
        presentation and attracting young audiences. International Kabaddi
        competitions are governed by organizations such as the International
        Kabaddi Federation, which organizes world-level championships and
        promotes the sport globally.

        Kabaddi offers several physical and mental benefits, including improved
        strength, agility, endurance, reflexes, and decision-making skills. It
        also teaches discipline, teamwork, and courage. Kabaddi can be pursued
        as a professional career, with opportunities as players, coaches,
        referees, and sports trainers. Its cultural significance and exciting
        gameplay make Kabaddi one of the most respected and loved traditional
        sports in India.
