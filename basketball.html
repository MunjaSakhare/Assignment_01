      <h2>Basketball Information</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Basketball is a fast-paced and popular team sport played worldwide,
        especially in countries like the United States, Canada, Spain, and the
        Philippines. It was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith and is played
        between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court. The main
        objective of the game is to score points by throwing the ball through
        the opponent’s hoop, which is mounted 10 feet above the ground.
        Basketball requires speed, agility, coordination, and quick
        decision-making.

        The game is played using a round ball, and players advance the ball by
        dribbling or passing it to teammates. Points are awarded based on where
        the shot is taken: a field goal inside the three-point line earns two
        points, a shot beyond the three-point line earns three points, and free
        throws earn one point each. The team with the highest score at the end
        of the game wins. A standard basketball match is divided into four
        quarters, with short breaks in between.

        Basketball involves both offensive and defensive strategies. Offensive
        play focuses on scoring through shooting, layups, dunks, and teamwork,
        while defensive play aims to prevent the opposing team from scoring
        through blocking shots, stealing the ball, and maintaining strong
        positioning. Common violations in basketball include traveling, double
        dribble, and shot-clock violations, which result in a turnover of
        possession.

        Basketball is played at various levels, from school and college
        competitions to professional leagues. The National Basketball
        Association (NBA) is the most famous professional basketball league in
        the world, featuring top players from many countries. International
        basketball competitions are governed by FIBA, which organizes
        tournaments such as the FIBA Basketball World Cup and basketball events
        at the Olympic Games.

        Beyond being a competitive sport, basketball offers numerous physical
        and mental benefits. It improves cardiovascular fitness, muscle
        strength, balance, and coordination. Basketball also teaches teamwork,
        discipline, leadership, and sportsmanship. For many athletes, basketball
        provides career opportunities not only as players but also as coaches,
        referees, trainers, and sports analysts. Its global appeal and exciting
        nature make basketball one of the most loved sports worldwide.
